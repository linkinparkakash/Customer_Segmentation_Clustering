# Customer_Segmentation_Clustering

## Project Title
Customer CLustering Segmentation and Understanding

## About the Project
This machine learning project focuses on customer clustering, which involves grouping customers based on similarities in their behavior and characteristics. The objective of this project is to help businesses gain insights into their customer base, and make data-driven decisions to improve customer experience and increase customer loyalty.

The project involves the use of various clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based clustering, to identify meaningful customer segments. The data used in this project typically includes customer demographics, transaction history, website interactions, and other relevant information.

The results of the customer clustering model can be used to develop targeted marketing campaigns, personalize product recommendations, optimize pricing strategies, and improve customer service. Ultimately, this project can help businesses enhance their competitive advantage by better understanding their customers and meeting their needs more effectively.
